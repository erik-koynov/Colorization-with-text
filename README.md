# Final Project for the Deep Vision Lecture
## Image colorization conditioned on text input
Driven by the knowledge that the main way of communication in human society is verbal
interaction, I propose a method to involve the user in the colorization process by
conditioning the output of the model on the verbal description of the scene. My model, although for now a proof of concept due to the short time I had to develop and
test it, makes it possible to implement very user friendly applications for colorization that
also take into account verbal descriptions.
